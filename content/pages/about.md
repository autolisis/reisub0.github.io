### Why, hello there.

I'm Govind and welcome to my blog. Right now I don't really have any specific topics I plan on covering, let alone an intent to post semi-regularly.

A bit about me: I'm a person who gets really excited about new technologies and paradigms. I always have a couple of experiments going on at any time. I have the attention span of a goldfish, but if something hooks me, I'm not afraid of going into a deep dive.

I don't really pigeonhole myself into any specific role or technology and I identify as a generalist. Computer science as a whole is one of my biggest passions due to the depth and breadth of exploration that's possible. 

There's a huge amount of attention to detail and hidden complexity that goes into designing even seemingly simple systems. There are so many [layers of abstraction](https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when) that go into play for just enabling you to read this text, and that utterly fascinates me. 

I try to capture some of my objects of fascination and share it in this blog.

I hope you enjoy reading through the posts in this blog.
