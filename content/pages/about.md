### Why, hello there.

Welcome to my blog. Right now I don't really have any specific topics I plan on covering, let alone an intent to post semi-regularly.

A bit about me: I'm a person who gets really excited about new technologies and paradigms. I always have a couple of experiments going on at any time. I have the attention span of a goldfish, but if something about it hooks me, I'm not afraid of going into a deep dive.

Here are some of the things that are currently "Top of mind" in the same vein as [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes):

##### Knowledge Management
How do you efficiently capture knowledge in such a way that it is possible to easily make connections without putting too much effort into the system?

Essentially, our brain remembers connections/relations and not raw facts. Our knowledge is most closely represented as a network graph (or a mind-map) but most of our knowledge is stored in a linear fashion (MS Word, Evernote, etc). Even so called knowledge wikis like Confluence make it too hard for you to link to another page, introducing too much friction in the process. They also lack other features like backlinks.

There's already a very familiar example of what a non-linear system would look like and that's a Wiki like Wikipedia. There's a sense of discovery that comes from browsing through pages on Wikipedia, even if they're the ones you've seen before, as there's always another link you haven't clicked on. The "Holy Grail" of Knowledge Management would be a personal Wiki which accurately maps your own brain.

Some google-friendly keywords if you're interested: zettelkasten, digital garden, building a second brain, smart notes. If you're looking for an app to help you achieve the same, I highly recommend [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).


##### Functional Programming
If you're looking for a language to begin your functional journey, I actually recommend you start with one of the many multi-paradigm languages like [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) or [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org) and then move to "purer" languages like Clojure or Haskell.

I also highly recommend the languages that compile to Javascript as a middle ground. Some examples of this include Elm, Reason and PureScript.

If building robust distributed systems is what you care about, then there's nothing that comes close to the power provided by the Erlang VM, and [Elixir](https://www.elixir-lang.org) is an excellent way to leverage it.

Some google-friendly keywords if you're interested in learning more: pure functions, side effects, immutability, higher-order functions, pattern-matching.
